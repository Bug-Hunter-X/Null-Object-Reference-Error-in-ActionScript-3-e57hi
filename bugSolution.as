The solution involves checking if myObject is null before accessing its name property.  If it's null, a default value is used or an alternative action is performed, preventing the runtime error.

```actionscript
package
{

    public class BugSolution
    {

        public function BugSolution()
        {
            var myObject:Object = null; // Simulate a potentially null object

            //Check if the object is null before accessing its properties
            var name:String = myObject != null ? myObject.name : "Unknown"; 
            trace("Object name: " + name); // Output will now be "Object name: Unknown"
        }
    }
} 
```
