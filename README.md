This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: a null object reference. The bug.as file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.as provides a corrected version. The error arises from attempting to access a property of an object that hasn't been properly initialized or is null.  The solution emphasizes robust null checks before property access. This scenario is frequently encountered in complex applications involving dynamic object creation and manipulation.
